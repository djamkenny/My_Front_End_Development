## My process

I start building fron the html where i added all the elements with class name that i will use in the css file.
In the HTML file i have a body - div.hero - div.container - sections.image and section.description

I generally select the html file and set the padding and margin to 0.
with the body selected I display it content to flex, justifying and aligning it content to center

The .hero and .container also display flex and centered content

.container div has two section for the image and the description which also I styled to suit the project

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

Building a project step by step involves taking in task at a time and making sure you finish with it before going to the Next step
Make sure you text what you are working on to know how good you have improved

This part of the HTML element help you add icons to the web titile
<link rel="icon" type="image/x-icon" href="/images/favicon.ico">

### Continued development

I want to continue learning about CSS, I will like to know much about and not just CSS web styling
